Very easy 80-line leaks-free for both subjects

- Your code should be in a single file (micro_paint.c or mini_paint.c).
- You can start test.sh and it will generate random good or bad examples that will be tested by our_micro_paint and your program.
- The result of both programs (exit code) are tested and the output is tested with diff.
- A 0 indicates it tested a non-valid file and 1 a valid file.
- The tests end when an error occur, and you can see the example that caused the error in example_, and the good output in coutput and your output in output.

Only micro_paint.c and mini_paint.c are mine, all the other files come from https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03
